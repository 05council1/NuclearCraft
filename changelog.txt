v2o.0.5

+ Implemented multiblock logic system - addons can introduce their own mechanics!

* Fixed unphysical cluster-to-casing heat distribution mechanics
* Fixed potential activation of cells by other cells which themselves do not remain active

+ Added most recipes, some temporary, for SFR and MSR fuel manufactoring
* Revamped fuel reprocessing recipes
- Removed many unnecessary fission isotope fluids

+ Added world radiation block purification
- Removed unwieldy config for world radiation block effects

* Increased the energy output of high pressure and normal steam

+ Added config to use ore dictionary ingredients in basic ingot and block crafting/smelting recipes

* Tweaked a few heat sink rules
* Tweaked the default moderator efficiency factors
* Tweaked radiation units from Rads/t to Rad/t

* Various bits of refactoring of multiblock API

v2o.0.4

* Hopefully fixed issues with fission cell activation on port-linking
* Fixed information about cell-reflector flux lines being lost

+ Added ability for addons to introduce custom neutron sources

* Tweaked a few heat sink placement rules
* Tweaked various multiblock component recipes
* Minor textures changes and refactors

v2o.0.3

+ Added fission port default behaviour, linking all cells' inventories

* Fixed moderators adjacent to cells but not in flux lines counting as active
* Fixed bug where cells would erroneously remain primed
* Fixed fuel in cells and casing coolant being lost on world load

+ Added IC2 coolant heating solid fuel reactor recipe
* Hot reactor components will burn when contacted
* Improved performance of (de)activating neutron sources
* Fixed flickering of neutron source blocks' states
* Improved accuracy of reactor GUI information

* Revamped turbine dynamo coil placement rules
* Total coil requirements are now 'per bearing'
* Fixed buggy rotor shaft double-rendering
+ Added ability for addons to introduce custom dynamo coils

+ Added axial states to multiblock ports and vents
+ Added recipes for various multiblock parts

* Reorganised creative tabs
* Added and spruced up various info tooltips
* Slightly tweaked a few config option defaults
* Reorganised many multiblock texture assets

v2o.0.2

+ Revamped CraftTweaker integration

* Fixed small efficiency calculation bug
* Added more useful information to the fission reactor GUI
* Tweaked fission sink cooling rates

* Fixed TRISO fuel not having a radiation level
* Fixed radiation-related crash with Cubic Chunks installed

* Renamed and reorganised a few processor blocks and classes

v2o.0.1

* Fixed various bugs in the calculations of fission reactor stats

v2o.0.0

* Initial overhaul build!
