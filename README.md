Issues & Pull Requests
----------------------

I welcome all bug reports, questions, suggestions and pull requests - I'd say most of the content that this mod has to offer is based on discussion and suggestions, and so is a crucial and exciting part of development. I will try to reply as quickly as possible, but keep in mind that I am very busy some parts of the year any may be rather inactive during these times.


Permissions
-----------

To paraphrase the late Christopher Hitchens, "Every time you prohibit someone from using your mod, you make yourself a prisoner of your own actions, because you deny yourself the opportunity to have people use it." I think this should give a reasonable idea of how little I care for licensing, but for those who want a little more formality, let it be stated that all code, excluding the bundled APIs from other mods (which are covered by their respective licenses), is available under the CC0 1.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).
